htmlmathml-f.ent
================
The HTML MathML Entity Set is recommended by W3C for any new document type
and is used by HTML 5 and MathML 3.

Found via W3C's XML Entity Definitions for Characters (3rd Edition)
https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/#htmlmathml

Can also be found relative to the MathML 3 DTDs.
HTML5 does not have a DTD.


w3centities-f.ent
=================
A superset of HTML 5, with additional Greek fonts.

Found via W3C's XML Entity Definitions for Characters (3rd Edition)
https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/

Some legacy entity sets are presented as tables, but there's a link to Entity Declarations
on the side panel.


entities.json
=============
Contains the HTML 5 entities in a JSON file.
Each entity is on a single line, so doesn't need a JSON parser.
There's a link to the HTML 5 JSON file
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/entities.json
below the table in the WHATWG HTML 5 specification
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html


HTMLlat1.ent, HTMLsymbol.ent, HTMLspecial.ent
=============================================
HTML 4 uses three entity sets, documented in the specification.
https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/sgml/entities.html

The entity definition files can be found relative to HTML4 DTDs.
https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/sgml/entities.html

Display one of the HTML 4.01 DTDs (strict.dtd, loose.dtd, frameset.dtd) in a browser and then modify
the URL to each of the .ent files in turn. The files are not displayed,
but are downloaded immediately (might be browser dependent).

XHTML uses the same entity sets as HTML 4. See section A.2. Entity Sets in
https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#dtds
but modified to be valid XML 1.0 entity declarations.
Downloads listed in the same section.

Could XHTML variants avoid warnings in IDEs?
No, Eclipse Ant Builder (default XML editor) still doesn't like them, but the files
do look more like regular XML and it's good to ensure EntitySetBuilder
handles both.

But XHTML includes &apos;, it's in xhtml-special.ent.
But section "C.16. The Named Character Reference &apos;"
says that &apos; is not supported?
Added a filter to the read with EntitySetBuilder.
